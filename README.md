# Inteliigent-Parking-System
This is a simulated parking system that can:
- Change the building plan by altering the number of floors and the number of cars that can fit in each row
- Change the rates according to the owner's interests
- Display the current status of each floor
- Give a unique ID to each car and store time information to later charge that car
- Display current profits


Note: Resize the panels a bit everytime to see the save and back button,a minor bug in code.
